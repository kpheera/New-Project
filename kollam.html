        <p>Kollam (erstwhile Quilon) is a southern district of Kerala, located 70 km north of the state’s capital Thiruvananthapuram. It is flanked by the Arabian sea on the west, Tamil Nadu on the east, Alapuzha and Pathanamthitta districts on the north and Thiruvananthapuram district on the south. Housing a population of over 2.6 million, Kollam is one of the more densely peopled districts of India. The head quarters of the district administration is centred at Kollam City, the district’s capital. Administratively, the district is composed of two revenue divisions viz. Kollam and Punalur with three taluks each under them.
            Like the rest of Kerala, Kollam is climactically temperate with a generally sunny weather peaking in heat during April-May. The monsoon falls from June to September. The soil is varyingly loamy, laterite and forest at the coastal regions, mainland and the forest areas respectively.</p>

                    Palaruvi Waterfalls, which literally translates to ‘Stream of Milk’. The white-stream waterfall descending from the height of 300ft resembles the shape of a horse’s tail. An ideal time to visit this place is from June to January.  It is the 32nd highest waterfall in India, also known to have Ayurvedic properties. The roaring sounds of the fall stand in stark contrast to the silence of the forests and mist-kissed mountains around it, therefore making it among the best tourist spots in Kollam.

                    The incredible beauty of Kerala, Ashtamudi Lake, it’s name has been derived from two words 'Ashta' meaning eight and 'Mudi' meaning branch, thereby stating the fact that lake has eight branches. It’s the second largest lake in Kerala. Thick coconut groves and palm trees can be seen all along the banks of the lake. The banks of the lake are also famous for the Chinese fishing nets. Backwater cruises are also available in the lake, between Kollam and Alappuzha. The boat cruise to Munroe Islands is a wonderful experience. There are many resorts along the lake that offer variety of water sports.

This beach is famous among some travellers with the name of Mahatma Gandhi Beach and soothes wanderers with lush green, calm backwaters, and endless water activities. The beach also has a lighthouse called the Tangasseri Lighthouse, which is a major landmark there. The cultural and spiritual aura of the beach is indeed contagious and fills the visitors with renewed energy and passions.
